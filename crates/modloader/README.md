# Harmony modloader

A familiar, yet powerful take on a modding system for the Bevy game engine 🫰

> **⚠️This is a work-in-progress**

A bevy modding system using wasm micro-modules. Keep bevy's ergonomic design for your modders (and yourself 😏).

This will eventually come with first class support for:

- Configurable mod permissions
- Authentication and mod signing
- Automatic updates
- Hot reloading
- And more yet to come!
